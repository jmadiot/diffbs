# diffbs

diffbs is a diff and sort for betaseries

diffbs uses [betaseries](http://www.betaseries.com) to see your progression on tv series.
It will give you a list of series to watch with your friends, sorted so that it minimises
the number of shows that you and your friend will have to watch again.

## Installation

Put `index.php` in a directory on your php-able server, create a directory `cache` inside it,
and chmod it so that php can create files into it.
